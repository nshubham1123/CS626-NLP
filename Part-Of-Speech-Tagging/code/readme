# POS tagger models implemented:
- Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM)
- Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)

# Usage instructions
run using shell file as follows:

    bash run.sh model

example:
    bash run.sh hmm
    (will print output to stdout and write it to file output_hmm.txt)

or, use directly as follows:

    usage: NLTK_DATA='./data' python3 main.py [-h] model
    
    Perform pos-tagging using various models.
    
    positional arguments:
      model       Pos tagger to use: one of {hmm, svm, bilstm}
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit


Example: (run from root folder of the project.)

    NLTK_DATA='./data' python3 main.py bilstm

will run bilstm with all the default parameters.

# Packages required:
	gensim (for word2vec used in svm, bilstm)
	sklearn (for svm)
	tensorflow, keras (bi_lstm)

Data to run on is shipped with (in ./data folder.)
