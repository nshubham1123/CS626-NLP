*****************************************
For CP to DP conversion-
*****************************************
Since there was problem in running python file because we used berkeley Neural Parser to get CP Tree for given input sentence which is only compatible with tensorflow 1.x , so we added python notebook.

Run python notebook named - CP_to_DP.ipynb.
In 3rd cell 1st line , give sentence of your choice , it will print Actual CP string , Actual DP Tree and Predicted DP Tree with corresponding head and label accuracy.
